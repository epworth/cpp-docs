# Global variables and standard types

The Microsoft run-time library contains definitions for [global variables](./global-variables.md), [control flags](./control-flags.md), and [standard types](./standard-types.md) used by library routines. Access these variables, flags, and types by declaring them in your program or by including the appropriate header files.
