# Debug routines

The debug version of the C runtime library supplies many diagnostic services that make debugging programs easier and allow developers to:

- Step directly into run-time functions during debugging

- Resolve assertions, errors, and exceptions

- Trace heap allocations and prevent memory leaks

- Report debug messages to the user

## Debug versions of the C runtime library routines

To use these routines, the [`_DEBUG`](./debug.md) flag must be defined. All of these routines do nothing in a retail build of an application. For more information on how to use the new debug routines, see [CRT debugging techniques](./crt-debugging-techniques.md).

| Routine | Use |
|--|--|
| [`_ASSERT`](./reference/assert-asserte-assert-expr-macros.md) | Evaluate an expression and generates a debug report when the result is `FALSE` |
| [`_ASSERTE`](./reference/assert-asserte-assert-expr-macros.md) | Similar to `_ASSERT`, but includes the failed expression in the generated report |
| [`_CrtCheckMemory`](./reference/crtcheckmemory.md) | Confirm the integrity of the memory blocks allocated on the debug heap |
| [`_CrtDbgBreak`](./reference/crtdbgbreak.md) | Sets a break point. |
| [`_CrtDbgReport`, `_CrtDbgReportW`](./reference/crtdbgreport-crtdbgreportw.md) | Generate a debug report with a user message and send the report to three possible destinations |
| [`_CrtDoForAllClientObjects`](./reference/crtdoforallclientobjects.md) | Call an application-supplied function for all `_CLIENT_BLOCK` types on the heap |
| [`_CrtDumpMemoryLeaks`](./reference/crtdumpmemoryleaks.md) | Dump all of the memory blocks on the debug heap when a significant memory leak has occurred |
| [`_CrtIsMemoryBlock`](./reference/crtismemoryblock.md) | Verify that a specified memory block is located within the local heap and that it has a valid debug heap block type identifier |

| [`_CrtIsValidPointer`](./reference/crtisvalidpointer.md) | Verify that a specified memory range is valid for reading and writing |
| [`_CrtMemCheckpoint`](./reference/crtmemcheckpoint.md) | Obtain the current state of the debug heap and store it in an application-supplied `_CrtMemState` structure |
| [`_CrtMemDifference`](./reference/crtmemdifference.md) | Compare two memory states for significant differences and return the results |
| [`_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince`](./reference/crtmemdumpallobjectssince.md) | Dump information about objects on the heap since a specified checkpoint was taken or from the start of program execution |
| [`_CrtMemDumpStatistics`](./reference/crtmemdumpstatistics.md) | Dump the debug header information for a specified memory state in a user-readable form |
| [`_CrtReportBlockType`](./reference/crtreportblocktype.md) | Returns the block type/subtype associated with a given debug heap block pointer. |
| [`_CrtSetAllocHook`](./reference/crtsetallochook.md) | Install a client-defined allocation function by hooking it into the C run-time debug memory allocation process |
| [`_CrtSetBreakAlloc`](./reference/crtsetbreakalloc.md) | Set a breakpoint on a specified object allocation order number |
| [`_CrtSetDbgFlag`](./reference/crtsetdbgflag.md) | Retrieve or modify the state of the `_crtDbgFlag` flag to control the allocation behavior of the debug heap manager |
| [`_CrtSetDumpClient`](./reference/crtsetdumpclient.md) | Install an application-defined function that is called every time a debug dump function is called to dump `_CLIENT_BLOCK` type memory blocks |
| [`_CrtSetReportFile`](./reference/crtsetreportfile.md) | Identify the file or stream to be used as a destination for a specific report type by `_CrtDbgReport` |
| [`_CrtSetReportHook`](./reference/crtsetreporthook.md) | Install a client-defined reporting function by hooking it into the C run-time debug reporting process |
| [`_CrtSetReportHook2`, `_CrtSetReportHookW2`](./reference/crtsetreporthook2-crtsetreporthookw2.md) | Installs or uninstalls a client-defined reporting function by hooking it into the C run-time debug reporting process. |
| [`_CrtSetReportMode`](./reference/crtsetreportmode.md) | Specify the general destination(s) for a specific report type generated by `_CrtDbgReport` |
| [`_RPT[0,1,2,3,4]`](./reference/rpt-rptf-rptw-rptfw-macros.md) | Track the application's progress by generating a debug report by calling `_CrtDbgReport` with a format string and a variable number of arguments. Provides no source file and line number information. |
| [`_RPTF[0,1,2,3,4]`](./reference/rpt-rptf-rptw-rptfw-macros.md) | Similar to the `_RPTn` macros, but provides the source file name and line number where the report request originated |

## C runtime routines that aren't available in source code form

The debugger can be used to step through the source code for most of the C runtime routines during the debugging process. However, Microsoft considers some technology to be proprietary and, therefore, doesn't provide the source code for a subset of these routines. Most of these routines belong to either the exception handling or floating-point processing groups, but a few others are included as well. The following table lists these routines.

Although source code is available for most of the `printf` and `scanf` routines, they make an internal call to another routine for which source code isn't provided.

## Routines that behave differently in a debug build of an application

Some C run-time functions and C++ operators behave differently when called from a debug build of an application. (You can create a debug build of an application by either defining the `_DEBUG` flag or by linking with a debug version of the C run-time library.) The behavioral differences usually consist of extra features or information provided by the routine to support the debugging process. The following table lists these routines.

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      C [`abort`](./reference/abort.md) routine
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
