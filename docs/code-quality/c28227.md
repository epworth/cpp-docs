# Warning C28227

> Annotation cannot also be a PrimOp (see prior declaration)

This warning indicates that the named annotation is being declared as an ordinary annotation, and also was previously declared as a PrimOp. This warning shouldn't be possible if the standard macros are being used for annotations. We don't expect this warning to be seen in typical use.
