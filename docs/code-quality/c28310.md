# Warning C28310

> The <annotation_name> annotation on '*function*' '*parameter*' has no SAL version.

All SAL annotations used in source code should have an annotation version applied by the use of SAL_name. This issue needs to be corrected in the macro definition.

This warning is reported only once per declaration. Inspect the rest of the declaration for more obsolete SAL.
