# Warning C28273

> For function '*function-name*', the clues are inconsistent with the function declaration

This warning indicates an error in the annotations, not in the code that is being analyzed. The annotations appearing on a function definition are inconsistent with the ones appearing on a declaration. The two annotations should be resolved to match.
