# Warning C28272

> The annotation for function '*function-name*', parameter '*parameter-name*' when examining '*clue*' is inconsistent with the function declaration

This warning indicates an error in the annotations, not in the code that is being analyzed. The annotations appearing on a function definition are inconsistent with the ones appearing on a declaration. The two annotations should be resolved to match.
