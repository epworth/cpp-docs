# Warning `C26835`

> `RtlCompareMemory` returns the number of matching bytes. Consider replacing this call with `RtlEqualMemory`

## Remarks

When `RtlCompareMemory`'s return value is treated as a boolean, it evaluates to true when there is at least 1 equal byte before finding a difference. Moreover, comparing the result of `RtlCompareMemory` to 0 evaluates to false if there is at least 1 matching byte. This behavior may be unexpected because it's different from other comparison functions such as `strcmp`, making the code harder to understand. To check for equality, consider using `RtlEqualMemory` instead.

This warning is available in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7 and later versions.

## Example

```cpp
int foo(const void* ptr)
{
    if (RtlCompareMemory("test", ptr, 5) == 0) // C26835
    {
        // ... 
    }
}
```

To fix the issue, verify if the original intention was to check for equality and replace the function call with `RtlEqualMemory`:

```cpp
int foo(const void* ptr)
{
    if (RtlEqualMemory("test", ptr, 5)) // C26835
    {
        // ... 
    }
}
```
