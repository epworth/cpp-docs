# Warning C28022

> The function class(es) '*classlist1*' on this function do not match the function class(es) '*classlist2*' on the typedef used to define it.

This warning is reported when there's an error in the annotations. Both the typedef and the function itself have `_Function_class_` annotations, but they don't match. If both are used, they must match.
