# Warning C6201

> Index '*index-name*' is out of valid index range '*minimum*' to '*maximum*' for possibly stack allocated buffer '*variable*'

This warning indicates that an integer offset into the specified stack array exceeds the maximum bounds of that array. It may potentially cause stack overflow errors, random behavior, or crashes.

## Remarks

One common cause of this defect is using an array's size as an index into the array. Because C/C++ array indexing is zero-based, the maximum legal index into an array is one less than the number of array elements.

Code analysis name: `INDEX_EXCEEDS_MAX`

## Example

The following code generates warning C6201. The **`for`** loop condition exceeds the valid index range for `buff` when it sets `i` to 14, which is one element past the end:

```cpp
void f()
{
    int buff[14]; // array of 0..13 elements
    for (int i = 0; i <= 14; i++) // i == 14 exceeds the bounds
    {
        buff[i] = 0; // initialize buffer
    }
}
```

To correct the warning, make sure the index stays in bounds. The following code shows the corrected loop condition:

```cpp
void f()
{
    int buff[14]; // array of 0..13 elements
    for (int i = 0; i < 14; i++) // i == 13 on the final iteration
    {
        buff[i]= 0; // initialize buffer
    }
}
```
