# Warning C28219

> Member of enumeration expected for annotation the parameter in the annotation

A parameter to an annotation is expected to be a member of the named **`enum`** type, and some other symbol was encountered; use a member of that **`enum`** type. This warning usually indicates an incorrectly coded annotation macro.
