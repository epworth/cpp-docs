# Warning C28023

> The function being assigned or passed should have a `_Function_class_` annotation for at least one of the class(es) in: '*classlist*'

This warning is often reported when only one function class is in use and a callback of the appropriate type isn't declared.

This warning is issued when the function on the left side of the assignment (or of the implied assignment, if it's a function call) is annotated to indicate that it's a driver-specific function type that uses the `_Function_class_` annotation, or a typedef that contains such an annotation. The function on the right side of the assignment doesn't have a `_Function_class_` annotation. The function on the right should be annotated to be of the same type as the function on the left. Often the best approach is to place the declaration \<class1> \<funcname1> before the current first declaration of \<funcname2>.
