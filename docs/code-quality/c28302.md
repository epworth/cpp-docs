# Warning C28302

> For C++ reference-parameter '*parameter_name*', an extra `_Deref_` operator was found on '*annotation*'.

This warning is reported when an extra level of `_Deref_` is used on a parameter of a reference type such as `T &a`. A common mistake when using SAL1 annotations is to use `__deref` on a reference type. Reference types are understood by SAL, so all annotations are already applied to the underlying type. It's typically not an issue in SAL2 because the free-floating `__deref` annotation was removed. If you intend to apply an annotation to a subtype, then you should instead use the SAL2 `_AT_` or `_Outref_` annotations.

## Example

```cpp
// Oops, trying to apply __elem_writableTo to the pointer being referenced
void f( __deref __elem_writableTo(size) int *& buffer, int size);

void func()
{
  int buffer[100] = {};
  int *pbuffer = buffer;
  f(pbuffer, 100);
}
```

To address the issue, update to SAL2 annotations:

```cpp
// Fix warning by switching to SAL2 syntax which has annotations that better describe what the function does.
void f( _Outref_result_buffer_(size) int *& buffer);
```
