# Warning C28215

> The typefix cannot be applied to a parameter that already has a typefix

Applying a `__typefix` annotation to a parameter that already has that annotation is an error. The `__typefix` annotations are used only in a few special cases. We don't expect this warning to be seen in normal use.
