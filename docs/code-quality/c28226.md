# Warning C28226

> Annotation cannot also be a PrimOp (in current declaration)

This warning indicates that the named annotation is being declared as a PrimOp, and also was previously declared as a normal annotation. This warning shouldn't be possible if the standard macros are being used for annotations. We don't expect this warning to be seen in typical use.
