# Warning C33001

> VARIANT '*var*' was cleared when it was uninitialized (expression '*expr*')

## Remarks

This warning is triggered when an uninitialized `VARIANT` is passed to an API such as `VariantClear`
that expects an initialized `VARIANT`.

Code analysis name: `VARIANTCLEAR_UNINITIALIZED`

## Example

The following sample code causes warning C33001:

```cpp
#include <Windows.h>

HRESULT foo(bool some_condition)
{
    VARIANT var;

    if (some_condition)
    {
        //...
        VariantInit(&var);
        //...
    }

    VariantClear(&var);     // C33001
}
```

These warnings are corrected by ensuring `VariantClear` is called only for a properly initialized `VARIANT`:

```cpp
#include <Windows.h>

HRESULT foo(bool some_condition)
{
    VARIANT var;

    if (some_condition)
    {
        //...
        VariantInit(&var);
        //...
        VariantClear(&var);     // C33001
    }
}
```
