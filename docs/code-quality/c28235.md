# Warning C28235

> The function cannot stand alone as an annotation

This warning indicates that an attempt was made to use a function that wasn't declared to be an annotation in an annotation context. This includes using a primitive operation (PrimOp) in a standalone context. This warning shouldn't be possible if the standard macros are being used for annotations. We don't expect this warning to be seen in typical use.
