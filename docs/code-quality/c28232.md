# Warning C28232

> \_Pre\_, \_Post\_, or \_Deref\_ not applied to any annotation

This warning indicates that a `_Pre_`, `_Post_`, or `_Deref_` operator appears in an annotation expression without a subsequent functional annotation; the modifier was ignored, but this warning indicates an incorrectly coded annotation.
