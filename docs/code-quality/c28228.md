# Warning C28228

> Annotation parameter: cannot use type in annotations

This warning indicates that a parameter is of type that isn't supported. Annotations can only use a limited set of types as parameters. This warning shouldn't be possible if the standard macros are being used for annotations. We don't expect this warning to be seen in typical use.
