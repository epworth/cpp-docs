# Warning C6296

> Ill-defined for-loop: Loop body only executed once

## Remarks

This warning indicates that a for-loop might not function as intended. When the index is unsigned and a loop counts down from zero, its body is run only once.

Code analysis name: `LOOP_ONLY_EXECUTED_ONCE`

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
void f( )
{
   unsigned int i;

   for (i = 0; i < 100; i--)
   {
      // code ...
   }
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
void f( )
{
   unsigned int i;

   for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)
   {
      // code ...
   }
}
```
