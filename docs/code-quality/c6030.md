# Warning  C6030

> Use attribute [[noreturn]] over __declspec(noreturn) in function '*function-name*'

## Remarks

This warning suggests using the C++11 standard attribute `[[noreturn]]` in place of the declspec variant `__declspec(noreturn)`. The standard attribute provides better cross-platform support because it doesn't rely on language extensions.

This warning is off by default and isn't part of the `All Rules` rule set. To enable this warning, it must be added to the rule set file being used.

This check is available in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0 and later versions.
Code analysis name: `USE_ATTRIBUTE_NORETURN`

## Example

The following code generates C6030:

```cpp
__declspec(noreturn) void TerminateApplication();

```

Fix the issue by using the `[[noreturn]]` attribute:

```cpp
[[ noreturn ]] void TerminateApplication();

```
